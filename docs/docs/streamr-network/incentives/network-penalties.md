# Network penalties
Penalties are required to keep node operators honest.

## Normal slashing
Operators promise to deliver, but what happens if they break that promise? Well, they will lose some of their staked DATA tokens in a process that’s commonly referred to as “slashing”. Delegators are also at risk of losing value if they delegate to unreliable Operators.

Operators will lose **10%** of their staked tokens if they are found to be violating protocol rules while engaged in a stream Sponsorship. The same penalty applies if Operators decide to unstake from a Sponsorship prematurely.

To avoid being slashed ensure that your node is connectable and up to the challenge of distributing data on the sponsored stream. Running [redundanct nodes](../network-roles/operators#node-redundancy-factor) is an excellent way to protect yourself against slashing.
