/*
 * Given:
 * - one sponsorship
 *   - it generates 20 DATA of earnings per second
 * - one operator who mines the sponsorship by running one node
 *   - it has operatorâ€™s cut of 10%
 * - one external delegator
 *
 * When:
 * - the operator self-delegates 123 DATA
 * - the external delegator delegates 200 DATA
 * - operator stakes all delegated tokens (i.e. 300 DATA)
 * - operator runs the operator node until the sponsorship no longer funded (~30 seconds)
 * - operator unstakes all delegated tokens
 * - operator and the external delegator undelegate all tokens
 *
 * - protocol fee is 5% of 600 DATA = 30 DATA
 * - operator's cut is 10% of the remaining 570 = 57 DATA
 *   - the operator has automatically self-delegated that amount
 *   - therefore the stakes after that are: operator 123+57=180 DATA, external delegator 200 DATA
 * - their share of the 570 DATA profit is:
 *   - operator: 180/380*570 = 270 DATA
 *   - extrenal delegator: 200/380*570 = 300 DATA
 *
 * Then:
 * - both the operator and the external delegator receive their staked DATA plus profits to their wallets
 *   - operator has 270+123=393 DATA
 *   - external delegator has 300+200=500 DATA
 * - protocol fee of 3 DATA is transferred to the admin wallet
