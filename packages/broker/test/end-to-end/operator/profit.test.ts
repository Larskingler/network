/*
 * Given:
 * - one sponsorship
 *   - has 600 DATA sponsored
 *   - it generates 100 DATA of earnings per second
 * - one operator who mines the sponsorship by running one node
 *   - it has operatorâ€™s cut of 10%
 * - one external delegator
 *
 * When:
 * - the operator self-delegates 500 DATA
 * - the delegator delegates 526 DATA
 * - operator stakes all delegated tokens (i.e. 1026 DATA)
 * - operator runs the operator node until the sponsorship no longer funded (~6 seconds)
 * - the operator unstakes from the sponsorship
 *   - this triggers withdraw of earnings 
 *   - and the stake is returned to operator contract
 * - the operator and the delegator have earnings:
 *   - all 600 DATA from the sponsorship, excl. protocol fee 30 DATA = 570 DATA
 *   - operator's cut is 57 DATA
 *   - operator token's worth is delegations + profit, excl. operator's cut = 500+526+570-57=1539 DATA
 *     - i.e. the exchange rate is token's worth divide by the delegated DATA = 1539/1026=1.5
 *   - operator auto-delegates the operator's cut of 57 DATA by using the current exchange rate of 1.5
 *     - operator's self-delegation increases by 57/1.5=38 operator tokens
 *     - operator owns (500+38)*1.5=807 DATA
 *     - delegator owns 526*1.5=789 DATA
 *
 * Then:
 * - the operator and the external delegator undelegate all tokens
 * - both the operator and the external delegator receive their staked DATA plus profits to their wallets
 *   - operator receive 807 DATA, i.e. profit is 807-500=307 DATA
 *   - external receive 789 DATA, i.e. profit is 789-526=263 DATA
 * - protocol fee of 30 DATA is transferred to the admin wallet
